8.	Disable Unwanted SUID and SGID Binaries
9.	Selinux:  (When using Linux, SELinux should be considered. Linux server hardening is a primary focus for the web hosting industry, however in web hosting SELinux is probably not a good option as it often causes issues when the server is used for web hosting purposes.)
